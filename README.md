# AssemblyVM
<p>A Swift Application
	<p>Structured with inspiration from the PDP-11 computer <p>
  <p> Implemented a virtual machine that can take in assembly code files and executes themâ€”also generates corresponding listing, symbol, and binary files for reference.</p>
  <p>Developed a Turing Virtual Machine in assembly language as another layer of abstraction (can run on top of  the pre-existing software). </p>
